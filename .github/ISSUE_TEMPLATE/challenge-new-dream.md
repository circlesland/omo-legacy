# How do OMO-Dream Challenges work?
OMO is the abbreviation for "open minded organization talents". The OMO-Methodoloy is a very simple process definition which strives to empower you to continuously grow towards your dreams in many small iterative steps, while collaborating openly and asynchronously, hand-in-hand with a clear vision.
In order to stimulate creativity, engagement and fun, every dream will be defined clearly by starting to ask WHY. The more careful and the better the questions are posed, the better will be the results.

## 1. WHY? Learn about the purpose of your dream

### Why does this matter? Which experience and behavior do you want to inspire? 
_Try to understand and define the status quo experiences that are painful and the feelings and experience you wish to enjoy. Try to become an expert of your dream by learning and gathering as much knowledge and wisdom as possible, with the goal to turn your dream into a well defined challenge_ 

**Link the painful experiences, you wish to end**   



**Link the gainful experiences, you wish to enjoy**



**Research and gain wisdom to solve your challenge**

## 2. HOW? Brainstorm how can you solve your dream challenge. 

### How do you incentivize the new experience and behaviour? Specify clear potential actions, which will enable you to grow closer to your dream. 
_Try to generate the full spectrum of ideas and possibilities from as many perspectives as possible - the more the better. Be open about every additional idea and feedback and never break the magic seed of inspiration_

**Link your ideas** 



___
## 3. WHAT? What kind of prototypes can you build to test your ideas?

### What prototypes are able to trigger and satisfy the intended experience and behaviors in the best ways? 
_Try to define the fastest, cheapest and most promising way to validate and test your assumptions. This is all about hands on, everything is allowed, be creative, mockups, pr√§sentations, games, interviews, polls, websites etc, the more interactive the better_

**Link your prototypes (WIP: pull-requests)**



___
## 4. WHO? Who is the most talented and best at implementing your dreams together with you?

### Who is able to ship and deliver a full working proposal?
_Try to pull in the most suited dreamers, makers, hackers, entrepreneurs and collaborators to get the job done fast and efficiently. Define clear actions and responsibilities_

**Link your responsibilities**



___
## 5. WHERE? Feedback on the implemented proposal

### Where is this proposal leading you next?
_Try to judge the implemented proposal based on its ability to incrementally improve over the original intended experiences and incentivized behaviors. Accept or reject the proposal, if needed, consider to pivot radically on your current strategy and adjust your prioritization roadmap accordingly._

**Link your proposals (pull-requests)**
